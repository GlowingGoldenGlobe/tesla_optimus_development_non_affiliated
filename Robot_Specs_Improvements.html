Tesla Optimus (Tesla humanoid)

How
  Make the Tesla Optimus team (Tesla employees), do all of the operations, listed in this document.

Infinity 3D Builder API
  Build 3D Objects - can build anything
    Builds per likelihood of demographics; material resources availability; extrapolation options (buttons and descriptions of tentative innovative results) to user
  3D Physics Simulations
    Predicted trajectories and courses of action
    Multiple predicted options    
  Language Model to 3D Builder
    API to translate language to 3D simulations of the Infinity 3D Builder API
      In this document, I'm calling it, "NLP to 3D Simulations API".
    
Collaborate (Partnerships, and Acquisitions)
  Blender
  Unity3D
    Research - To be researched to discover which, of all the options, is the best 3D API company.
  etc.
  Language Model APIs
    Research - Find the best fitting NLP APIs companies.
    Maybe you can buy a license to use one of the NLP.
  
Teams:  Software
  Infinity 3D Builder API
  3D Physics Simulations - motion options
  NLP to 3D Simulations API - interpreting user communications and commands for the Infinity 3D Builder API
  ASI APIs (see "ASI APIs", below)
  
Teams:  Hardware:  Robot Engineering
  Speed - per joint movement motion speed optimization
    Talk to the engineers to discover how they can team to specialize on tasks (to categorize specialization teams). The more engineers, the better.
  Motion agility
  Material strength
  Micro-chip
    Micro-chips:  examples of possibilities 
      micro-chip #1 - brain: knowledge of communications and thinking
      micro-chip #2 - mechanical processing of limbs
      micro-chip #3 - computer software integration for robot-to-computer-interactions and processing
    These multi-micro-chips robot-anatomy member parts will allow simultaneous multi-functionality of the robot. 
      Example:
        the robot can think and talk to you while it is uploading data to a computer.
        the robot can move and process predictions of motions and future courses of behavior, while it is thinking about communications and talking to someone, and controlling its motions (all three of those types of actions can be processed on separate chips, simultaneously)
        Example:
          the robot can communicate with someone, and
          simultaneously predict its motions, and
          simultaneously communicate with software, wirelessly, to another computer, and
          compose procedures of tentative future tasks
            this is separate from bodily motion behavior, because immediate bodily motion behavior can calculate immediate simulations of vicinity events; meanwhile,
            the other micro-chip can calculate, simultaneously, future procedures of tasks to be accomplished and 3D simulations of those future bodily behavior courses of action of those procedures; meanwhile,
            the robot can talk to you; and, meanwhile,
            the robot can integrate information, wirelessly, to software of a separate computer, from another micro-chip processor

ASI APIs
This is a separate team of software developers.
This team builds per task objective achievement APIs, specialized per tasks to be accomplished.
  Examples: 
    How the robot will get its information for its task: auto mechanic. How the robot will build 3D simulations of tentative procedures of its future actions.
    How the robot will get its information for its task: washing dishes.
    How the robot will get its information for its task: Customer Service Representative at McDonald's restaurant.
    How the robot will get its information for its task: accounting.
    How the robot will get its information for its task: FBI agent.
    How the robot will get its information for its task: Walmart Associate.
    How the robot will get its information for its task: waiter.
    How the robot will get its information for its task: registered nurse.
Methods for obtaining information for ASI APIs:
  Surveillance video - translation to 3D simulations of behavior and procedures; plus, coupled 3D simulations of events with document manuals of business operations (cross-examination of predictable events, to create 3D simulations of predicted courses of actions).
  Setup cameras (which we might call, "observation cameras") in businesses (those which are successful businesses which have trained, experienced employees) for this surveillance purpose.
  Instructional Videos.
    Create 3D simulations of behaviors for specific categories of tasks.
    This might also be done for Language Models, so that the the robot can mimic communication behaviors, expressions, relevant discourse concepts text, and associated jargon.
  Movies.
    Create 3D simulations; categorize the simulations for future use.

Something about this - important note:
  The 3D simulations need only be methodical, procedural - script procedures and methods of (1) obtaining data and for (2) concocting data 3D simulations for behavior actions.
  This means: that the actual videos built do not necessarily need to be retained as electronic documents of recorded robot memory, because the 3D simulation's methods and procedures for the robot to build the 3D simulations in real time, per given situations will be built by these ASI software engineers as "ASI APIs", like so.      
  What the robot won't need is the concocted 3D simulations of predicted events.
  What the robot will need is access to the source files of the video content (rather, relevant, generic 3D simulations made from these, but not as comprehensive predictions of all behaviors); AND documented manuals of policies and procedures of businesses.
  
Additionally

I also need to the Tesla Optimus team to work on engineering the design of a micro-robot-composite humanoid Tesla robot.
  Purpose: more useful; versatile, transform-able, reconstructable (self-assembling; AND replaceable parts at a small (even micro or, at least, tiny) scale)
  Gigafactory for building these.
  Provide these to U.S. citizens (the 150 million human resources of the U.S. nation, currently employed).
  The robots will pay the company for their own sale price, within 60 months to 3 years, approximately.
  
Government Program
  The U.S. Government must adopt (acquire) the ASI Humanoids and take control of safety, security and ASI API control and robot ASI API downloads control. 
  
  Purpose:  to prevent humanoid startups from taking over the world (startups, such as Tesla Inc., but Tesla is not the only startup that may soon have the power to takeover the world; once the technology is underway and commercially understood, Joe Doe may also have the power to takeover the world).

  Research and Development:  connections
    Purpose:  All of the below, for the purpose of composing tiny-composite (and micro-composite) robot motion-capable tiny parts making up motion-capable larger parts of the anatomy of the Tesla Optimus humanoid.
    hydraulic connections (fluid pressure; valve doors (openings which can close upon reaction and syntax commands); fluid inflation; fluid deflation)
    air and gas pressure connections (inflation; deflation; pressure tension in body parts)
    electromagnetic connections
    magnetic connections
    mechanical touch connections
    joint connections
    fitted connections (example - male-to-female ends, e.g. socket and electric wire input to socket (tongue-and-groove))
    gear connections; gear-like connections
    wrap connections
    suture connections
    skin elements connections; bone elements connections; etc. - to mimic these types with other material connections
    
    Area of interest:  rate of speed;  rate of change;  rate of motion;  rate of actions of body parts;  rate of motion of tiny-robot-composite parts; rate of agility motions; rate of strength bolster motions
    Area of interest:  self-assembling
    Area of interest:  self-parts-replacing (self-fixing); damage control; longevity; 
      Area of interest:  upgrade-able-ready-always;  self-assembly-upgrading-able-robot
    Area of interest:  durability
    Area of interest:  agility
    Area of interest:  resource availability
        
    don't use(??):
    screw bolt connections
    pulley connections
    reason:  because they are not micro-robot or tiny-robot useful options
